 Task 1:
 The goal of this task is to experiment with image stitching methods. 
 Two images may have the same background but different foreground. 
 For example, a moving person may be moving in the scene. 
 You need to stitch the two images into one image eliminating foreground objects that move in the scene. 
 You may assume that the region where a foreground object covers the background has similar characteristics to the rest of the background and is visible in two or more images.
 
 
 Task 2:
 This task aims to stitch multiple images into one panoramic photo.
